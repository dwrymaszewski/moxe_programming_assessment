# moxe_programming_assessment
 Small project that will hopefully get me hired at Moxe

TO RUN
Install node: https://nodejs.org
navigate to the project folder in a shell
do "npm install"
do "node ."

TO RUN TESTS
navigate to project folder in a shell
do "mocha"
(you might need to 'npm install -g mocha' first.  the docs seemed to suggest this wasn't necessary, but i couldn't get it to go on my windows machine before a global install)
